# Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
  The project was to count the number of items purchased in a given day.  It used both C++ and Python to achieve this tasks.  The problem it solved was       using Python to process the data on the back-end and to use C++ to visualize the results.
# What did you do particularly well?
  I believe the portion of the project I did well was the error handling.  When the end user entered an invalid option or entered an item that was not in     the list of items it returned an error that was in red text. 
# Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
  One area I believe I could enhance my code might be to change the way the code was visually represented.  I don't know if it would make my code more       efficient, secure but it might help the end user understand the results better.
# Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support      network?
  The piece of code that I found challenging was with the Python code and making sure the code was spaced appropriately.  I found on several occassions       that my code was not correctly spaced, this had unexpected results and I had to read my code taking special care to pay attention to the correct number     of spaces.  There was no tools or resources used other than my reading the code multiple times and making corrections when needed.
# What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
  The skills of how to integrate Python into a C++ project and use the two languages together.  Using Python as a back-end and C++ as a front-end might be   beneficial in the future.  I can see this as something that is definitely transferable to other projects.
# How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
  The code in the project is made readable by properly commenting the code and applying standards that may help future developers use my code if needed.     Adapatable, I'm not sure if the code is not that adaptable but with proper commenting it may prove to be adaptable.  By providing proper documentation it   makes the code more maintanable.
